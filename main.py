**A Note on This Prototype:**

This is an interactive demo designed to showcase the core vision of **Clurious**.

**The Problem We're Solving:** We believe the current "one-size-fits-all" approach to test series is broken. It fails to personalize and often leads to student demotivation rather than targeted improvement.

**Our Mission with Clurious:** To build a truly adaptive learning platform where the focus shifts from generic testing to personalized growth. We empower students to compete with themselves, turning every quiz into a clear, actionable step towards success.
